- If you want to bring changes in to the body of the app you have to use a base layer from the tailwind in to the global.css
  for example we want the change the color of the whole app body, we use base layer then @apply because apply enables you to write a tailwind code instead of css.
  ` @layer base { body { @apply bg-black } }`
